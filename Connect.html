        <div class="text-box"><h6>The current market of the voice interface based smart product isn't quite bit nor historical as the other digital product industry. Connect's competitors are Smarthome, HoneyCo, and Best Buy. 
          This three had the most similar concept and ideas for target audience. <br> HoneyCo is the only company focusing on a specific target audience. Such as aging aduts and family for care giving needs.
        Whereas, Smarthome and Best Buy focus on a middle-class family who wants to improve their house quality through both VI smart product and non-VI interfaced smart home devices. <br><br>
            Smarthome and Best Buy is a franchised retail store with assorted smart devices for a quick and simple search. Brand are limited and not all the employees are informed about the products they are selling.
            These two companies provide a product under particular categories (i.e., Lightning, thermostats, security, door lock, more home control) Where the product is specifically offer to improve the house quality.<br><br>
