<h4>The current house market is continuously raising hight that is no longer affordable for many people in the U.S, and smart house products been becoming part of our lives. 
  Where multiple products are existing separately in the house that is controlled by AI, such as Alexa and Google home. Where some users need to set multiple AI in different 
  spaces in order to control the installed smart house products, SHL wants to avoid having multiple AI in a single house. That way, the user will no longer need to suffer 
  installing and finding their AI and provide affordable houses with built-in AI systems that allow users to utilize small house spaces fully with live customization.</h4>
